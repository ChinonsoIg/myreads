# MyReads Project
This project can be used to search and store books on different shelves, depending on the books you have read, the ones you are currently reading, and the ones you want to read. 
The link to the hosted version is: [MyReads](https://chinonso-myreads-app.netlify.app).

## Purpose
This App was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program, to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of React applications.

## Installation
The project uses Node.js and the create-react-app starter. If you do not have Node installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to stave the project and run the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/ChinonsoIg/myreads.git
npm install
```
The above commands will clone the project into your local machine and install all the dependencies

Once the denependencies are installed, launch the app by running the command:

```
npm start
```
A new browser should automatically open displaying the app. However, if this doesn't happen, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the project live in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.
